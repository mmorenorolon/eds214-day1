# Automate

## Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document
Meets spec: Rendered document shows all the moving parts of the analysis with exported sections for clear understanding. 

## The analysis runs without errors
Meets spec: Yes, the analysis runs without errors. 

## The analysis produces the expected output
Meets spec: This analysis produces the expected output. The figure has the nutrients were are supposed to look at and looks very similar to the final figure. Good job!

## Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)
Meets spec: The data cleaning is in the R folder in its own script. 

# Organize

## Raw data is contained in its own folder
Meets spec: The data is in the "raw data" folder with the approriate .csv files. 

## Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data
Meets spec: The plotting and cleaning are in the R folder. Maybe if you export code from line 82 as a csv file it could make it more consistent with your other exported graphs.

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
Meets spec: Yes, the function is in its own file. It looks great, don't forget to add explanations of the parameters in the roxygen skeleton. 

# Document

## The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs
Not yet: The README looks amazing but may need suppporting code. I loved the addition of the file structure, perhaps expand on that. 

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works
Meets spec: The flowchart properly depicts your workflow and clearly explains how to run the analysis. Good job!

## The code is appropriately commented
Not yet: The majority of your code is commented properly. Don't forget to add explanations of the parameters in the roxygen skeleton and comment on the script plotting.R with more details about what is being accomplished in the script. 

## Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention
Meets spec: The names are very consistent, I liked how you went beyond and named some more variables. 

# Scale
Scale

## Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
Not yet: Make sure to create an "environment initialization"  script in R. 

## The analysis script runs without errors
