#Exceeds specs

## Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

I set up the .qmd file so that rendering it runs the whole pipeline and also made it clear in the README how a user can reproduce the results.

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

I moved key code into 3 functions and saved them as their own files. This makes the workflow easier to reuse (reproducibility) in a professional setting. 

# Collaboration

1.

For the peer feedback portion of the project, I was thorough by reviewing each spec and selected two (2) specs that I felt required the most attention to my peer. I contributed to my peer's README to give a purpose of the project and gave them suggestions for how they can improve their README. My peer had one recurring message in their rendered Quarto document (`paper.qmd`) and I gave feedback to hide that message so their rendered document isn't overloaded with that message. Lastly, my second contribution to my peer's project was adding a comment to a line of code to explain what the purpose of the line of code does and it's purpose.

This is the commit on GitHub where I added the line of code that produced the merge conflict. I resolved the merge conflict manually in the GitHub page on the file. I deleted the headers that marked the merge conflict.
